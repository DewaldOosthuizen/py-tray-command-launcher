## Configuration

Create a `commands.json` file in the `config` directory to define your commands. Example structure:

```json
{
    "System": {
        "Open Terminal": {
            "command": "terminator",
            "showOutput": false,
            "confirm": false
        },
        "System Update": {
            "command": "terminator --command 'bash -c \"sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; exec bash\"'",
            "showOutput": false,
            "confirm": true
        }
        // ... more commands
    },
    "Media": {
        "Youtube Music": {
            "command": "/opt/brave.com/brave/brave-browser --profile-directory=Default --app-id=111",
            "showOutput": false,
            "confirm": false
        }
    }
    // ... more categories
}
```

- Use `{promptInput}` in commands to prompt for user input.
- Specify `"icon"` for custom icons.
- Specify `"showOutput"` if the output should be displayed in a separate window.
- Set `"confirm": true` for commands that require confirmation.

## Running the App

1. **Activate the virtual environment.**
2. **Run the application:**

    ```sh
    python3 src/main.py
    ```

    If you encounter issues with the virtual environment, try:

    ```sh
    venv/bin/python3 src/main.py
    ```

3. **Run in the background:**
    - Using `nohup`:

        ```sh
        nohup python3 src/main.py &
        ```

    - Using `&`:

        ```sh
        python3 src/main.py &
        ```
